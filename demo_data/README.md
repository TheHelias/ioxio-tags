# IOXIO Tags demo metadata

This data is hosted on tags.ioxio.dev, and gives an idea for how the hosted metadata should look
like for use with IOXIO Tags based Digital Product Passports.

E.g. uploading a file to `images/foo.jpg` would lead to it being hosted at
https://tags.ioxio.dev/images/foo.jpg

When adding images, please try to be mindful of reasonable image sizes, and put them through some
basic image optimizer.
